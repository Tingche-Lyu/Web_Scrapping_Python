# Web_Scrapping_Python

This repository contains a sample code of web scrapping. 
The goal is to download the hospital provider data from Intuitive (Da Vinci's parent company) by state.

Then, I compiled data, combined with data from other source (Definitive), removed the duplicate ones, and visualize using Tableau.
