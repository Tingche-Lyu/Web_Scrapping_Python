# Web_Scrapping_Python

This repository contains a sample code of web scrapping. 
The goal is to download the hospital provider data from the competitor by state.

Then, I compiled data, combined with claims data, removed the duplicate ones, and visualize using Tableau.

Similarly, the other web scrapping file is the code to scrap data of procedure volume based on CPT codes and States in the US. By compiling data via R and visualizing through Tableau, one is able to see the trend of clinical service of his/her interest over year.
